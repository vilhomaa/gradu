Code for my Master's thesis'.

The dgp.R is the data generating process I defined in section 3.1

main_analysis.R executes the analysis as I set it up in part 3.2
main_analysis_run_parallel.R does the same but by using all cores -> runtime approx 9,5 days with amd ryzen 5

analysis_of_results.R conducts the analyses done in section 4.

dgp_summary.R does the analysis in appendix 3

forest_comparison.R does the analysis in appendix 6

The package relies heavily on the paper of Lemmens and Gupta - https://github.com/ProfitBoost-Lab/ProfitBoost
